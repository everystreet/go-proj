# go-proj

Go bindings for PROJ (formerly PROJ.4) - a library for performing conversions between cartographic projections, maintained by the OSGeo organization. See https://proj.org for more information.

## Usage

`go-proj` uses Cgo to wrap the PROJ library with a Go interface. As such, in order to use this package, you must first install PROJ. The PROJ website contains [details several methods](https://proj.org/install.html) for installing the library, but you may find that these sources are not up-to-date enough to provide the version that this package targets (see `PROJ_VERSION` in [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile)) - in this case you can either compile from source (ensuring that you're using the correct tag), or use the [official Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/osgeo/proj/).

You can verify the installation by running the command below and checking that the version number matches the aforementioned `PROJ_VERSION`:

```bash
proj --version
```

Then `go-proj` can be added to your Go module as usual:

```bash
go get -u github.com/everystreet/go-proj
```

## Developing

These bindings are generated by "[c-for-go](https://c.for-go.com)".

```bash
podman build -t go-proj-builder .
podman run -v ${PWD}:/build:Z --rm go-proj-builder
```
